            Instructions for Oral Presentations and Posters – Geomare Speeches 2024
            Dear participants,
            Below are the detailed instructions for oral presentations and posters at the Geomare Speeches
            2024 conference. Please follow these guidelines to ensure the smooth running of the event.
            A. Oral Communications

            Oral communication should be prepared using Microsoft PowerPoint or .pdf format.
            The presentation should have a 16:9 aspect ratio.
            The maximum presentation time is 5 minutes, followed by 3 minutes for questions.
            You must send the presentation file via this e-mail by the 11th of November.
            Please carry a copy of the presentation just in case, preferably on a USB stick or
            external hard drive.
            We request that participants in the first oral session contact the organizing committee
            during registration. Those with presentation times after the poster session can post their
            presentations during the coffee break.
            The conference makes no copyright claims on any item presented, and the authors are
            free to reuse their materials as they please.
            
            B. Posters

            preferred).
